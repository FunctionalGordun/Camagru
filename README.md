## Description
This first project puts you back in the bath after the PHP pool: you will have to create, in PHP, a small Instagram-like site allowing users to make and share photo-montages. You will thus implement, with your bare hands (frameworks are prohibited), the basic functionalities encountered on the majority of sites with a user base.
